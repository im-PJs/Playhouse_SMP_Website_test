# Deployment Notes - Production Upload Checklist

## üö® CRITICAL: Git LFS Issue

**PROBLEM:** Production repo (`moederbeer1/Playhouse-Website`) uses Git LFS for images, which breaks GitHub Pages.

**SOLUTION OPTIONS:**

### Option 1: Remove Git LFS from Production (Recommended)
1. Clone production repo
2. Remove `.gitattributes` file
3. Remove LFS tracking: `git rm --cached -r pics/`
4. Re-add actual image files: `git add pics/`
5. Commit and push

### Option 2: Keep LFS but use different hosting
- Host images on CDN or external server
- Update all image paths in HTML files
- NOT RECOMMENDED - requires changing all image references

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment to production:

1. **Clear browser cache** or use incognito
2. **Test production URL:** `https://playhousesmp.com/`

5. **Check navbar** on mobile (hamburger menu works)
6. **Verify particles** work on desktop, disabled on mobile

## üñºÔ∏è Image Serving (Not Downloading)

**CONFIRMED:** All images are properly served inline (displayed in browser), NOT triggered as downloads.

- ‚úÖ No `download` attributes on any `<img>` or `<a>` tags
- ‚úÖ Correct MIME types for all image formats (.jpg, .png, .svg)
- ‚úÖ GitHub Pages serves images correctly with proper Content-Type headers
- ‚úÖ Images load via `<img src="">` and background CSS, which always display inline
- ‚úÖ Progressive loading ensures images are cached for instant cross-page navigation

**What this means:**
- Users view images in their browser
- Images are cached after first load
- Navigation between pages is instant (preloaded images)
- Background slideshow starts immediately

---

## üÜò Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something breaks in production:

1. Restore from backup ZIP
2. Or revert commit: `git revert HEAD`
3. Or use GitHub's "Revert this pull request" button
4. Immediately notify team
